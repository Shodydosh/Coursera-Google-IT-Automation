## Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages
- Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Bash, and PowerShell are all examples of interpreted programming languages
  - slow nhưng có thể exec trên nhiểu platform, OS không cần compiler phù hợp.
- Java and C# are languages that use a mixed approach.
  - Cần compiler phù hợp với OS

## Benenfits of automation
- Automation can allow the IT infrastructure to scale, keeping pace with growth and demand.
- But as we've said before, automation is not a fix-all. If badly executed, automation can cause as many problems as it can solve.

## Pitfalls of automation
- [time_to_automate < (time_to_perform * amount_of_times_done)]
- [Pareto Principle](https://www.jrautomation.com/news/details/2016/01/01/80-20-pareto-principle) states that 20% of the system administration tasks that you perform are responsible for 80% of your work
- If an automated system fails and it goes unnoticed the consequences can be really bad.
- Automation, it's an incredibly powerful tool that saves time, reduces mistakes, and facilitates growth and scalability. But we need to apply it thoughtfully to avoid some of the pitfalls that can arise from its use. Keep these things in mind, and automation can be a valuable asset in your toolbox.
